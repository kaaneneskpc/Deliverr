The above diagram illustrates the application's architecture, showcasing:

- **Presentation Layer**: UI components (Compose), ViewModels, and UI States
- **Domain Layer**: Use cases, domain models, and repository interfaces
- **Data Layer**: Repository implementations, data sources (local and remote)
- **Common**: Shared utilities, extensions, and base components
- **Module Relationships**: Dependencies between different modules and components
- **Data Flow**: How data flows through the system from user actions to data persistence

This architecture follows clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns, making the codebase maintainable, testable, and scalable.

## Tech Stack

- **UI**: Jetpack Compose, Material 3 Design, Compose Navigation, Animations
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Kotlin Coroutines, Flow
- **Dependency Injection**: Dagger Hilt
- **Networking**: Retrofit, OkHttp, Interceptors
- **Image Loading**: Coil
- **Maps & Location**: Google Maps Compose, Play Services Location
- **Authentication**: Google Identity, Facebook Login, Credentials
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe
